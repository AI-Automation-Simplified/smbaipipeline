# Dagster for SMBs: From Script Chaos to Unified AI Data Platform

![Before: The 'Glue' Trap & YAML Hell / After: The Dagster Foundation (Unified Platform)][def]

## Why Productionizing AI Fails for SMBs

Too many small and mid-sized businesses are stuck in the "glue trap":
- Scripts linked to notebooks and cloud APIs
- Countless YAML configs
- Expensive, fragile, and disconnected parts
- No cost visibility, monitoring, or audit trail
- “Operational nightmare” every time you try to scale or update

As projects grow, this approach leads only to burnout and brittle infrastructure.

## The Dagster Foundation: Unified, Reliable, Auditable

> **"Stop gluing scripts. Start building a foundation."**

With Dagster, your workflows are no longer a mess of duct-taped scripts and one-off jobs. You get:
- **A true orchestrator:** Central control plane for all your data + AI workflows
- **Cost tracking:** Full visibility into every OpenAI/LLM API call
- **Easy local development:** Test everything on your laptop before scaling
- **Asset-driven architecture:** Turn fragile scripts into production-ready assets you can monitor, version, and automate

**Example (see diagram):**
1. **Fetch customer reviews** from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram (via APIs)
2. **Store data in DuckDB** (local, open-source, no cloud costs)
3. **Analyze with OpenAI** (automatic cost tracking, no surprises)
4. **Auto-update your sales dashboard** every morning  
   → All with one unified, reliable pipeline!
